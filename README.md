# Introduce
This is the 2nd attempt for trainee for Andersen.

The 1st attempt https://github.com/ipk7218/andersen-trainee **is private**.

# About this code
1. Clone this repository. You need to have **Task1.py** and **Task2.txt**.

2. Open Task1.py via console (*No need to open Task2.txt.*):  
`
$ python COPYPATH
`  
COPYPATH is the path of your file Task1.py, for example:  
`
$
"C:\Users\User\Downloads\Task1.py"
`  
Then you need to choose youe number of task (1 or 2)

3. If you chose "1" then you need to choose sub-task:
    * Task1.1 - "1". On this task you need to insert number. For example: 10
    * Task1.2 - "2". On this task you need to type correct name. For example: Mikhail
    * Task1.3 - "3". On this task you need to type numeric array separated by commas. For example: 3, 4, 5

After choosing the number there will be execution of the choosen sub-task.

4. If you choose "2" Task1.py will open Task2.txt via console with questions and answers (not requires code for this task).
